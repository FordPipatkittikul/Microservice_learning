# Microservice_learning

Microservices is an architectural style where an application is structured as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other. Each service is designed to handle a specific business function and operates independently, meaning it can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.

Key Characteristics of Microservices

Independence – Each service runs in its own process and is independently deployable.

Single Responsibility – A service focuses on one business capability (e.g., user authentication, payments, or order processing).

Decentralized Data Management – Each microservice typically has its own database to avoid dependencies.

API-Based Communication – Services communicate via lightweight protocols like HTTP (REST), gRPC, or messaging queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ).

Scalability – Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.

Technology Agnostic – Services can be built using different programming languages and frameworks as long as they follow communication standards.

# Comparison to Monolithic Architecture

| Feature | Monolithic Application | Microservices Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | Single unit, all features together | Services deployed independently |
| Scaling | Scale entire application | Scale specific services |
| Flexibility | Difficult to change one part | Easier to update or replace services |
| Technology | Must use the same stack | Can use different stacks per service |
| Data Storage | Shared database | Each service manages its own data |
